## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Monorepo scaffold: FastAPI backend with `/health`, the SSE event stream and the workflow
  graph; component interfaces and registries; agent event schema; React dashboard shell with
  placeholder pages; Makefile, pre-commit, CI and contribution docs.

### Changed

- Every backend route now lives under `/api` (`/api/health`, `/api/runs/{run_id}/events`,
  `/api/runs/{run_id}/graph`, docs at `/api/docs`); the dev proxy is a single `/api` rule
  (ADR-004).

### Fixed

- CI backend job: pin `astral-sh/setup-uv` by commit SHA; `@v10` does not resolve.
